Hello Hardware Repository
===

### About
This is the home for all of Hello's hardware projects

### Projects
 - *Band* contains the schematics and PCB layout for the physical Band device
 - *Components* contains the Hello specific component library for Altium that is shared between projects

### Conventions
 - Commit early and often
 - Make many small commits based on discrete tasks
 - Use descriptive commit messages
  - *Good:* "Added MCU6738 to component library"
  - *Bad:* "Moar components"
 - Do you part in keeping the repo clean; keep .gitignore up-to-date
